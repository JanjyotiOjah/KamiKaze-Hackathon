Abstract
In the modern education system, artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance teaching
and assessment by automating tasks and providing insights. AI DRIVEN EVALUATOR is a smart platform that helps teachers create and evaluate tests while
assisting students with automated learning resources. This document presents an
overview of the project’s key features, divided into teacher and student dashboards,
highlighting AI-driven automation in education.
1 Introduction
Education technology has seen rapid advancements with AI-driven tools improving the
teaching and learning experience. AI DRIVEN EVALUATOR is a platform designed
to assist teachers in lesson management, test creation, and student performance tracking while enabling students to access AI-generated summaries, tests, and personalized
learning insights. This document outlines the system’s key functionalities.
2 Teacher Dashboard Features
2.1 Lesson Recording & Tracking
Teachers can input lesson content in various formats (text, PDFs, images, and videos).
AI then processes this information to:
• Generate key concepts and summaries.
• Organize lessons with date-wise tracking for future reference.
2.2 AI-Powered Test Creation
The platform offers manual and AI-assisted test generation:
• AI suggests multiple-choice, short-answer, long-answer, and coding-based questions.
• Adaptive testing adjusts difficulty based on student performance.

2.3 Student Performance Insights
AI analyzes test results and student interactions:
• Identifies commonly misunderstood topics.
• Alerts teachers if multiple students struggle with a concept.
• Suggests additional learning resources such as videos and articles.
2.4 Teacher-Student Communication
The system enhances interaction through:
• A chatbot that handles frequently asked questions.
• Automated feedback generation on student progress.
3 Student Dashboard Features
3.1 AI-Generated Lesson Summaries & Notes
AI automatically generates concise summaries of lectures, including:
• Bullet points, mind maps, and flashcards.
• Audio versions for easy accessibility.
• Instant AI responses to student queries.
3.2 Smart Q&A & Doubt Resolution
The system facilitates student engagement through:
• A frequently asked questions (FAQ) collection for teachers.
• AI-powered instant doubt resolution.
• A discussion forum for peer-to-peer and mentor interactions.
3.3 AI-Powered Test Evaluation & Scoring
Students take tests on the platform, where AI evaluates responses by classifying them
into:
1. Correct (Fully understood the concept)
2. Incorrect (Needs improvement)
3. Partially correct (Key points missing)
AI-generated feedback suggests improvements for incorrect answers.

3.4 Personalized Learning & Performance Tracking
AI continuously monitors student progress:
• Identifies weaknesses and strengths in different topics.
• Recommends extra practice materials for weaker areas.
• Displays performance trends to guide focused learning.
4 Conclusion
AI DRIVEN EVALUATOR is designed to revolutionize education by leveraging AI
for automated test creation, evaluation, and personalized learning. By integrating AIpowered insights, it enhances both teaching and learning, making education more efficient
and effective.
